## React-Redux To-Do App with Vite

This project is a simple To-Do application built using React, Redux, and Vite. It demonstrates how to manage data using Redux while providing a fast development experience with Vite.

**Features:**

- Add, edit, and delete To-Do items
- Mark To-Do items as completed
- Persist To-Do data in local storage
- Efficient API calls (fetches data only when local storage is empty)

**Setup:**

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

**Usage:**

The application will start at `http://localhost:5173/`. You can interact with the To-Do list to add, edit, and delete items. The app will automatically save your To-Do items to local storage and retrieve them upon refresh.

**Tech Stack:**

- React
- Redux
- Redux Toolkit (recommended)
- Vite
- Local Storage (for persistence)

**Further Development:**

- Implement API integration for storing and retrieving data (optional)
- Add features like filtering and sorting To-Do items
- Enhance styling and user interface

**Note:**

This is a basic example to showcase the use of React, Redux, and Vite. You can extend it further to build more complex and feature-rich applications.
